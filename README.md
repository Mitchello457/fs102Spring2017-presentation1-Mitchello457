# seke2015-panel-presentation

This repository contains the HTML source code and additional resources for a presentation that I, [Gregory M.
Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham), gave at a panel at the 27th International Conference on
Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2015). The presentation's source code uses the
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) framework to control the display of each slide.

You are free to
use any of the entries in this file if you are interested in citing one of these research deliverables in a LaTeX
document. This repository is used in [gkapfham/curriculum-vitae](https://github.com/gkapfham/curriculum-vitae) to
automatically create several sections of my curriculum vitae.
