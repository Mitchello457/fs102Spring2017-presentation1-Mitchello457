# seke2015-panel-presentation

This repository contains the HTML source code and additional resources for a presentation that I, [Gregory M.
Kapfhammer](http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham), gave at a panel at the 27th International Conference on
Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2015). The presentation's source code uses the
[reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) framework to control the display of each slide. I have developed a
custom theme for the display of the slides and the use of full-screen photographs on the backgrounds.

You are welcome to use these slides as inspiration for your own presentation. If you find this example useful, could I
trouble you to star this repository and the acknowledge it in your own presentation slides? If you would like to learn
